# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude vs X): https://anulkar.github.io

* Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations obtained from plotting weather data.
* Created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. Each page contains the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. The home page (or landing page) provides a summary of the project. Also added a comparison page of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
